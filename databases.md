## Relational Databases

| Tool Name | Description | Why Consider | Why Avoid | License | Recommended for Dev | Recommended for Prod |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **PostgreSQL** | Advanced open-source relational database with strong standards compliance | Extremely feature-rich, extensible, robust, supports JSON, great community, excellent data integrity, advanced features (partitioning, replication) | Can be more resource-intensive than simpler databases, complex configuration for optimal performance tuning | PostgreSQL License (similar to MIT/BSD) | Yes | Yes |
| **MySQL/MariaDB** | Popular open-source relational database | Wide adoption, good performance, extensive tooling ecosystem, easy to set up, many hosting options | Less advanced features than PostgreSQL, different SQL dialect compliance | GPL (MySQL), LGPL (MariaDB Community) | Yes | Yes |
| **SQLite** | Self-contained, serverless SQL database engine | Zero-configuration, file-based, embedded, perfect for development, reliable | Not suitable for high concurrency, limited write scalability, limited network access | Public Domain | Yes | No (except for low-write edge cases) |
| **CockroachDB** | Distributed SQL database with strong consistency | Horizontal scaling, survivability, PostgreSQL-compatible, automated scaling and healing | Higher latency than single-node databases, relatively new, complex distributed architecture | BSL (source available, not fully open source) | Yes | Yes (for distributed scenarios) |

## NoSQL Databases

| Tool Name | Description | Why Consider | Why Avoid | License | Recommended for Dev | Recommended for Prod |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **MongoDB** | Document-oriented NoSQL database | Flexible schema, fast development, good for nested data, powerful query language, good scaling | Schema-less can lead to data inconsistency, complex transactions compared to SQL | SSPL (Server Side Public License) | Yes | Yes |
| **Redis** | In-memory data structure store | Extremely fast, versatile (caching, queues, pub/sub), simple to use, low latency | Primary in-memory (though persistence options exist), clustering more complex than some alternatives | BSD | Yes | Yes |
| **ScyllaDB** | High-performance NoSQL database compatible with Cassandra | Much better performance than Cassandra, low latency, horizontal scaling, compatible with Cassandra tooling | Complex data modeling, eventual consistency model requires careful design | AGPL | No (overhead for dev) | Yes (for high-throughput cases) |
| **InfluxDB** | Time series database designed to handle high write and query loads | Purpose-built for time series data, high ingest rate, SQL-like query language, retention policies | Limited use cases beyond time series data | MIT (OSS), Proprietary (Enterprise) | Yes | Yes (for time series data) |

## Time-Series Databases

| Tool Name | Description | Why Consider | Why Avoid | License | Recommended for Dev | Recommended for Prod |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **TimescaleDB** | Time-series database built on PostgreSQL | SQL interface, scales horizontally, built on PostgreSQL (inherits its reliability), good compression | More resource-intensive than purpose-built time-series DBs | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes |
| **InfluxDB** | Purpose-built time-series database | Optimized for time-series data, high ingest performance, purpose-built query language (Flux) | Limited use beyond time-series data | MIT (OSS), Proprietary (Enterprise) | Yes | Yes |
| **Prometheus** | Monitoring system and time-series database | Great for metrics, pull model, built-in alerting, extensive integration | Not designed for long-term storage without external components, focus on metrics rather than events | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes (with Thanos/Cortex for scaling) |
| **QuestDB** | High-performance time-series database | Extremely fast performance, SQL interface, low resource footprint | Newer project, smaller community compared to alternatives | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes (where performance is critical) |

## Graph Databases

| Tool Name | Description | Why Consider | Why Avoid | License | Recommended for Dev | Recommended for Prod |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Neo4j** | Native graph database focusing on connected data | Intuitive data model for relationship-heavy data, Cypher query language, visualization tools | Scaling can be complex, resource-intensive compared to relational DB for simple queries | GPL v3 (Community), Commercial (Enterprise) | Yes | Yes (Community for smaller deployments, Enterprise for larger) |
| **ArangoDB** | Multi-model database supporting graphs, documents, and key-value | Flexible data models in one DB, AQL query language, good performance, clustering support | Jack of all trades may not excel at any single model to the same degree as specialized DBs | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes |
| **JanusGraph** | Scalable graph database optimized for storing and querying graphs | Designed for scalability across multiple machines, can use various storage backends (Cassandra, HBase) | Complex to set up compared to Neo4j, requires more infrastructure components | Apache License 2.0 | No (complex for dev) | Yes (for large graph datasets) |
| **DGraph** | Distributed, transactional, open source graph database | Built for horizontal scalability from ground up, GraphQL-like query language, ACID transactions | Relatively newer, smaller community than Neo4j | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes (for cloud-native architectures) |

## Search Engines

| Tool Name | Description | Why Consider | Why Avoid | License | Recommended for Dev | Recommended for Prod |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Elasticsearch** | Distributed search and analytics engine | Full-text search, powerful analytics, extensive ecosystem (ELK stack), mature | Resource-intensive, complex configuration for optimal performance, learning curve for query DSL | Elastic License (not fully open source) | Yes | Yes |
| **Apache Solr** | Search platform built on Apache Lucene | Mature, stable, extensive features, focuses on text search use cases | Not as good for analytics as Elasticsearch, scaling more complex | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes |
| **Meilisearch** | Lightning-fast search engine focused on user experience | Extremely simple to set up, typo tolerance, filtering, fast results, modern | Not as feature-rich as ES or Solr, newer project | MIT License | Yes | Yes (for search-heavy applications) |
| **Typesense** | Fast, typo-tolerant search engine | Simpler than Elasticsearch, typo tolerance, proper multilingual support, faster setup | Smaller feature set than Elasticsearch, newer project | GPL v3 | Yes | Yes (for developer-friendly search) |

## Final Recommendations

### Development Environment

For a development environment, we recommend:

1. **Relational Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite (if zero-config is priority)
2. **NoSQL Database**: MongoDB for document storage, Redis for caching and simple data structures
3. **Time-Series Database**: TimescaleDB if you're already using PostgreSQL, InfluxDB otherwise
4. **Graph Database**: Neo4j for its ease of use and visualization tools
5. **Search Engine**: Meilisearch or Typesense for their ease of setup and developer experience

### Production Environment

For a production environment, we recommend:

1. **Relational Database**:
   - General purpose: PostgreSQL
   - Distributed SQL: CockroachDB for global distribution
   
2. **NoSQL Database**:
   - Document store: MongoDB
   - Key-value/caching: Redis
   - Wide-column store: ScyllaDB for high-throughput cases
   
3. **Time-Series Database**:
   - Metrics: Prometheus with Thanos/Cortex
   - Events/IoT data: InfluxDB or TimescaleDB (if already using PostgreSQL)
   - High performance: QuestDB
   
4. **Graph Database**:
   - Medium scale: Neo4j
   - Large scale: JanusGraph or DGraph
   
5. **Search Engine**:
   - Enterprise/analytics: Elasticsearch
   - Pure search functionality: Meilisearch or Typesense
