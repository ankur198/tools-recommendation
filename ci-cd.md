## CI/CD Platforms

| Tool Name | Description | Why Consider | Why Avoid | License | Recommended for Dev | Recommended for Prod |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Jenkins** | Extensible open source automation server | Extremely flexible, massive plugin ecosystem, mature, wide adoption, can handle any workflow | Resource-intensive, UI feels dated, complex to maintain at scale, manual configuration can lead to snowflake servers | MIT License | Yes | Yes |
| **GitLab CI/CD** | Integrated CI/CD within GitLab | Seamless git integration, containerized runners, easy YAML configuration, integrated with rest of GitLab platform | Requires GitLab as SCM, can get expensive at scale with premium features | MIT License (Community), Proprietary (Enterprise) | Yes | Yes |
| **Drone** | Container-native CI/CD platform | Lightweight, container-first, simple YAML syntax, extensible plugin system, modern architecture | Less mature than Jenkins, smaller community, fewer integrations | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes |
| **Concourse CI** | Pipeline-based continuous integration system | True pipeline as code, isolated builds, clean design principles, reproducible | Steep learning curve, less conventional approach, smaller community | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes (for complex pipelines) |

## Pipeline Orchestration

| Tool Name | Description | Why Consider | Why Avoid | License | Recommended for Dev | Recommended for Prod |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Argo Workflows** | Container-native workflow engine for Kubernetes | Kubernetes-native, DAG-based workflows, parallelism, complex job orchestration | Requires Kubernetes, overkill for simple CI/CD needs | Apache License 2.0 | No (complex for dev) | Yes |
| **Tekton** | Kubernetes-native CI/CD building blocks | Cloud-native, container-first, reusable components, strong abstractions | Relative newcomer, more complex than simpler tools, needs Kubernetes | Apache License 2.0 | No (overhead for dev) | Yes |
| **Jenkins X** | CI/CD solution for modern cloud applications on Kubernetes | Automated CI/CD for Kubernetes, GitOps built-in, preview environments | Steep learning curve, only for Kubernetes, complex architecture | Apache License 2.0 | No (complex for dev) | Yes (for Kubernetes environments) |
| **Buildkite** | CI/CD platform with self-hosted runners | Scalable, fast, agent-based, hybrid model (hosted + self-hosted) | Requires paid service for coordination, not fully self-hosted | Proprietary (platform), MIT License (agents) | Yes | Yes |

## Container Registry

| Tool Name | Description | Why Consider | Why Avoid | License | Recommended for Dev | Recommended for Prod |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Harbor** | Cloud-native container registry | Security scanning, RBAC, replication, Helm chart repository, multi-tenancy | Complex setup compared to simpler alternatives, resource requirements | Apache License 2.0 | No (overhead for dev) | Yes |
| **Docker Registry** | The official Docker registry server | Simple, lightweight, well-documented, official Docker project | Basic features, minimal UI without extensions | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes (with security additions) |
| **Nexus Repository OSS** | Multi-format artifact repository | Supports multiple formats (Docker, npm, Maven, etc.), mature, single solution for all artifacts | More resource-intensive, complex setup for advanced features | EPL | Yes | Yes |
| **Kraken** | Scalable P2P container registry | Highly efficient for large-scale deployments, P2P distribution, bandwidth optimization | Complex to set up, overkill for smaller teams, new project | Apache License 2.0 | No | Yes (for large-scale deployments) |

## Artifact Management

| Tool Name | Description | Why Consider | Why Avoid | License | Recommended for Dev | Recommended for Prod |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **JFrog Artifactory** | Universal binary repository manager | Supports all major package formats, mature, reliable, extensive features | Community edition limited, expensive for enterprise features | Proprietary (free limited edition available) | Yes (community edition) | Yes (if budget allows) |
| **Nexus Repository OSS** | Repository manager for many formats | Free, supports many formats, mature product, active development | UI can be slow, complex advanced configuration | EPL | Yes | Yes |
| **Cloudsmith** | Cloud-native artifact management | Modern, CI/CD focused, security features | Not fully self-hosted, paid service | Proprietary | No (not self-hosted) | No (not self-hosted) |
| **Archiva** | Extensible repository management | Lightweight, easy to set up, good for Maven/Java | Limited format support, less active development | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes (for Java-focused teams) |

## GitOps Tools

| Tool Name | Description | Why Consider | Why Avoid | License | Recommended for Dev | Recommended for Prod |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **ArgoCD** | Declarative GitOps for Kubernetes | User-friendly UI, built for Kubernetes, application focus, multi-cluster | Only for Kubernetes, requires cluster access | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes |
| **Flux** | GitOps operator for Kubernetes | Lightweight, Helm support, automated image updates, multi-tenant | Less visual feedback than Argo CD, Kubernetes-only | Apache License 2.0 | Yes | Yes |
| **Jenkins X** | CI/CD solution with GitOps for Kubernetes | Complete solution including CI and GitOps, preview environments | Complex, Kubernetes-only, steeper learning curve | Apache License 2.0 | No (complex for dev) | Yes |
| **Weave GitOps** | Enterprise GitOps platform | Dashboard, policy as code, multi-tenancy, delivery targets | Enterprise features require paid version, newer platform | Mozilla Public License 2.0 | No | Yes (enterprise) |

## Final Recommendations

### Development Environment

For a development environment, we recommend:

1. **CI/CD Platform**: Drone or GitLab CI - Both offer modern, easy-to-use experiences
2. **Container Registry**: Simple Docker Registry - Lightweight and sufficient for development
3. **Artifact Management**: Nexus Repository OSS - Versatile for multiple artifact types
4. **GitOps**: ArgoCD - If using Kubernetes, offers great visualization and easy setup

### Production Environment

For a production environment, we recommend:

1. **CI/CD Platform**:
   - Traditional/Enterprise: Jenkins - For maximum flexibility and existing investments
   - Modern Cloud-Native: GitLab CI or Drone - Better developer experience and container focus
   - Complex Workflows: Concourse CI - For strict pipeline isolation and complex dependencies
   
2. **Pipeline Orchestration**:
   - Kubernetes-native: Tekton - For modern cloud-native pipelines
   - Complex workflows: Argo Workflows - For complex DAG-based workflows
   
3. **Container Registry**:
   - General purpose: Harbor - Security-focused container registry
   - Multi-format: Nexus Repository OSS - When managing multiple artifact types
   - Large scale: Kraken - For bandwidth efficiency at scale
   
4. **Artifact Management**:
   - Budget-conscious: Nexus Repository OSS - Best free option with broad format support
   - Enterprise features: JFrog Artifactory - If budget allows and advanced features needed
   
5. **GitOps**:
   - User-friendly: ArgoCD - Better UI and application focus
   - Automation-focused: Flux - For automatic updates and multi-tenancy needs
