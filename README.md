## About This Repository

This repository aims to provide practical guidance for choosing self-hosted tools across different infrastructure domains. Each tool is evaluated based on several factors:

- **Description**: What the tool does and its primary purpose
- **Why Consider**: Strengths and advantages of the tool
- **Why Avoid**: Limitations and potential drawbacks
- **License**: Open source license or commercial terms
- **Recommended for Dev**: Suitability for development environments
- **Recommended for Prod**: Suitability for production environments

Our recommendations consider both the strengths and limitations of each tool to help you make informed decisions based on your specific requirements. At the end of each document, you'll find our final recommendations for development and production environments.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding new tools or updating existing recommendations through pull requests. When making contributions, please maintain the table format for consistency.
